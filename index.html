<strong><h3>School and Eeducation background</h3></strong>
<p>Just after completeing my high school in 2021 i immediately had an inspiration to pursue higher education.
And thats when i joined PC KINYAJUI TECHNICAL TRAINING INSTITUTAION and immediately started pursuing IT as a mainstream couse while doing other 
smaller courses on the side like learing programming by just using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">youtube</a> tutorials and possibly learn
a thing or two from there while still progresssing with my course.</a> </p>
<h4>GOALS</h4>
<p>With dreams and aspirationsof becoming a mainstream dveloper and work for some of the great companies,i am ready to do whatever it taakes to achieve it. <br>
At my young age just at 19 years old i have started working towards achieving my longterm goals which will benefit me in the future. <br>
I get my inspiration from listeing to other young briliant minds in the same industry as me and try to implement the same to my starting carrer. <br>
One day ,i'd like to work as a mainstream developer at one of the big and prestigions tech companies in the world,like APPLE,MICROSOFT,GOOGLE etc. <br></p>
